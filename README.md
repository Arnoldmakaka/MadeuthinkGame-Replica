# Madeuthink; Click the color and not the word
It's a replica of the madeuthink game where you click the color and not the word as you face some challenges along the way.
This application mainly uses react native reanimated (https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated) for the animations.

To test the game:
  1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/Arnoldmakaka/MadeuthinkGame-Replica
  2. Install the node modules (npm install)
  3. Then run android (npx react-native run-android)
  4. Enjoy

It can be improved and more details and challenges can be added on it.
